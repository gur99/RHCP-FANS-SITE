                <h2>Red Hot Chili Peppers</h2>

                <p>The Red Hot Chili Peppers are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1982, comprising
                    vocalist
                    Anthony
                    Kiedis, bassist Flea, drummer Chad Smith, and guitarist John Frusciante. Their music incorporates
                    elements
                    of
                    alternative rock, funk, punk rock, hard rock, hip hop, and psychedelic rock. Their eclectic range
                    has
                    influenced
                    genres such as funk metal, rap metal, rap rock, and nu metal. With over 120 million records sold
                    worldwide,
                    the
                    Red Hot Chili Peppers are one of the top-selling bands of all time. They hold the records for most
                    number-one
                    singles (15), most cumulative weeks at number one and most top-ten songs (28) on the Billboard
                    Alternative
                    Songs
                    chart. They have won three Grammy Awards, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012,
                    and
                    in
                    2022
                    received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p>

                <p>

                    The Red Hot Chili Peppers were formed in Los Angeles by Kiedis, Flea, guitarist Hillel Slovak and
                    drummer
                    Jack
                    Irons. Due to commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the band's 1984
                    self-titled
                    debut
                    album, which instead featured guitarist Jack Sherman and drummer Cliff Martinez. Slovak rejoined for
                    their
                    second album, Freaky Styley (1985), and Irons for their third, The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987).
                    Irons
                    left
                    after Slovak died of a drug overdose in June 1988.

                <p>
                    The Red Hot Chili Peppers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April 2012. The
                    induction
                    lineup was Kiedis, Flea, Smith, Klinghoffer, Frusciante, Slovak (represented by his brother James),
                    Irons and Martinez; Frusciante was invited, but did not attend. Navarro and Sherman were not
                    inducted;
                    Sherman said he felt "dishonored". The band performed "By the Way", "Give It Away" and "Higher
                    Ground",
                    which included Irons and Martinez on drums. It was the first time Kiedis and Flea had performed with
                    Irons in more than 20 years.

                <h2>Legacy and influence</h2>
                <p>The Red Hot Chili Peppers' mix of hard rock, funk and hip hop has influenced genres such as funk
                    metal, rap metal, rap rock and nu metal.

                    AllMusic claim that in 1992, "oodles of (mostly horribly bad) funk-metal acts were following in
                    Faith No More and the Red Hot Chili Peppers' footsteps." Bands who have cited the Red Hot Chili
                    Peppers as an influence include Incubus, Mr. Bungle, Primus, Rage Against the Machine, System of a
                    Down, Papa Roach, 311, and Sugar Ray.

                    The members of Korn, who were formerly in the funk metal band L.A.P.D., have also cited them as an
                    influence. Kiedis said the band were early to combine "hardcore funk and hip-hop-style vocals", and
                    suggested they had influenced Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, and Linkin Park. Smith said, "Certainly
                    Anthony's singing style and voice lends itself to being unique, and nobody sounds like him. The cool
                    thing about it is we can play any style of music whether it's hard and fast, or loud or quiet, slow
                    or medium, whatever it is, rock or funk, and it still sounds like us. I'm proud of that because
                    sometimes bands don't have that strong personality where you go, 'Oh, that's boom, right away.'"</p>

            <h2>Intresting Facts about RHCP:</h2>
            <h3><span>Haunted by success</span></h3>
            <p>

                The album that changed the image for the band, Blood Sugar Sex Magik, was recorded in 1991 in a mansion
                rumored to be haunted. The mansion was previously owned by the magician Harry Houdini, and was later
                purchased by music producer Rick Rubin who turned it into a home recording studio.</p>


            <h3><span>Who is the clown who changed the words</span></h3>
            <p>
                Musicians take seriously the words they write, some will say that their creation is like their "baby".
                However, when the Peppers played the special episode of The Simpsons for the return of Krusty the Clown,
                they made a slight and non-trivial change as stated in the lyrics. The changed line is from the popular
                song Give it Away. Instead of: What I got you got to get and put it in you, the band sang: What I'd like
                is I'd like to hug and kiss you?. The small change made the song suitable for listening to the whole
                family.</p>
            <h3><span>Israeli band member</span></h3>
            <p>Hillel Slovak (April 13, 1962 – June 25, 1988) was an Israeli-American musician, best known as the
                founding guitarist of the Los Angeles rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers, with whom he recorded two
                albums.Born in Israel, he later moved to the United States. Slovak met future bandmates Anthony Kiedis,
                Flea, and Jack Irons while attending Fairfax High School in Los Angeles.</p>

            <h3><span>The album that killed Slovak</span></h3>
            <p>
                The third album and the first to appear in the charts was The Uplift Mofo Party Plan released in 1987.
                For the production of the album the band received a budget of 5,000 dollars, with rumors saying that
                part of it was dedicated to the purchase of narcotics. Anthony and Slovac both suffered from drug
                addiction during these years, which finally cost Slovac his life in 1988. In 1992 after getting clean,
                Kiedis participated in an anti-drug video called "Trip on This" along with other well-known artists of
                the time such as the Beastie Boys.</p>
